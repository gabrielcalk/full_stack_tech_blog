## *Description*
This is a project involving the front-end and the back-end. In this application, I used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, Handlebars, Node.js and other libraries. With it, you'll be able to access other people's comments about different technologies and applications in the market, log in to make your own posts, edit them and log out. The entire application was built with basically javascript vanilla and the libraries and frameworks that it is possible to use with this language. Feel free to check out the project by clicking on the link above.
